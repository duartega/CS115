Debugging prints in output.  Please remove these before submitting your programs!

    if value_to_find not in search_list:
            print('**Binary search iterations:', count)
	            print('Binary search: None')
		            return None

Causes your program to execute a linear search within your binary search!  This is an unreasonable action for a binary search to perform.

binary_search returns the index of the value - 1 instead of the index itself!

        elif (mid_item == value_to_find):
	            print('**Binary search iterations:', count)
		                return middle - 1

This should have just been:

        elif (mid_item == value_to_find):
	            print('**Binary search iterations:', count)
		                return middle

This also caused you to correct the index within main:
            if binary_position != None:
	                    print('Binary search:', binary_position + 1)

fixing this in the recommended manner above would cause this code to change to:
            if binary_position != None:
	                    print('Binary search:', binary_position)

Which would also be compatible with printing None if binary_search returned it!


Thus you would be able to change:

    if value_to_find not in search_list:
            print('**Binary search iterations:', count)
	            print('Binary search: None')
		            return None

to:

	print('**Binary search iterations:', count)
			return None

and the code in main from:

            if binary_position != None:
	                    print('Binary search:', binary_position)

to:

			print('Binary search:', binary_position)
